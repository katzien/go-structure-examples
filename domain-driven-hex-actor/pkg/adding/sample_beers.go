		Name:    "Oatmeal Stout",
		Brewery: "Samuel Smith",
		Abv:     5,
		ShortDesc: "Brewed with well water (the original well at the " +
			"Old Brewery, sunk in 1758, is still in use, with the hard well " +
			"water being drawn from 85 feet underground); fermented in " +
			"‘stone Yorkshire squares’ to create an almost opaque, " +

		Name:    "Duvel",
		Brewery: "Duvel Moortgat",
		Abv:     9,
		ShortDesc: "A Duvel is still seen as the reference among strong " +
			"golden ales. Its bouquet is lively and tickles the nose with an " +
			"element of citrus which even tends towards grapefruit thanks to " +
			"the use of only the highest-quality hop varieties.",
	},
	{
		Name:    "Negra",
		Brewery: "Modelo",
		Abv:     5,
		ShortDesc: "Brewed longer to enhance the flavors, this Munich " +

		Name:    "Guinness Draught",
		Brewery: "Guinness Ltd.",

	{
		Name:    "XX Lager",
		Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
		Abv:     4.2,
		ShortDesc: "A crisp, refreshing, light-bodied malt-flavored beer with a well-balanced finish. " +
			"A Lager that drinks like a Pilsner. A liquid embodiment of living life to the fullest. " +
			"A beverage made from pure spring water and the choicest hops. A beer with such good taste, it’s chosen you to drink it.",
	},
	{
		Name:    "Tecate",
		Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
		Abv:     5,
		ShortDesc: "Very smooth, medium bodied brew. Malt sweetness is thin, and can be likened to diluted sugar water. " +
			"Touch of fructose-like sweetness. Light citric hop flavours gently prick the palate with tea-like notes that follow and fade quickly. " +
			"Finishes a bit dry with husk tannins and a pasty mouthfeel.",
	},
	{
		Name:    "Sol",
		Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
		Abv:     5,
		ShortDesc: "While Corona wins the marketing wars in the U.S., Sol is the winning brand in much of Mexico, despite not being a standout in any respect. " +
			"You see the logo plastered everywhere and it’s seemingly on every restaurant and bar menu. Like Corona, it’s simple and inoffensive, " +
			"but still slightly more flavorful than your typical American macrobrew. At its best ice cold, and progressively worse as it gets warmer.",
	},
	{
		Name:    "Corona",
		Brewery: "Cuahutemoc Moctezuma",
		Abv:     5,
		ShortDesc: "One of the five best-selling beers in the world, but it usually tastes better in Mexico, " +
			"where the bottles don’t have so much time in transit and on shelves. (Sunlight coming through clear bottles is never a good thing for beer.) " +
			"This is the typical “drink all afternoon” beer, working well on its own or with a plate of tacos. Refreshing with a lime.",
	},
